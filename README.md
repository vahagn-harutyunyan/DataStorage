1. We are creating a system that needs to have different implemntations for each of the storage mediums with a shared public interface. The interface should allow saving and loading of the values of a fixed set of types. So if we have an interface that satisfies this, each medium will need an implementation of that interface and can be fed into the main class that saves and loads data. This will satisfy the open-close principle and new implementations can be created in the future without a need to modify the old ones or the main class except for the "factory"-like part where one of the implementations is constructed and fed in.
2. Now that we have the common interface, 2 of 3 implementations, and some AI-generated tests. We will switch to the file based medium.
3. Now we are adding wrappers for the values in the storage that are easy to use. Those are reactive properties that store their values in the storage and set default values the first time they are initialized. This also allows the client code to decide which property values should be store immediately and which ones can be batched to reduce overhead.
